The basis of the project was to create a fully functioning table game application.

I couldn't find the exact requirements that this assignment asked me to do, however the main objectives were:

1 - To make clear and concise blocks of code. Notes before each block to easily determine function.

2 - Make applet interactive with different users

3 - No collisions with GUI objects

4 - Create zones in which objects will interact with

5 - Create pop up boxes example: error messages

6 - Make application functional with no bugs

7 - Overall use of objects, conditions and statments learned throughtout the session
